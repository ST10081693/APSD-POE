## Frontend Documentation

The frontend of this project is scaffolded using Angular CLI version 14.2.7, which provides a powerful set of tools to create, build, and test Angular applications.

## Development Environment

To launch a development server, execute the command ng serve. This will host the application on http://localhost:4200/. Live reloading is enabled, so any modifications you make to the source files will be immediately reflected in the browser.

## Component Generation

For creating new components, utilize the command ng generate component component-name. The Angular CLI also supports generation of other constructs such as directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, and modules using the ng generate command.

## Project Build

To compile the project, run ng build. The compiled output will be placed in the dist/ directory, suitable for production deployment.

## Testing

Unit Tests
Execute ng test to run unit tests through Karma(https://karma-runner.github.io/), ensuring that individual components meet their specifications and perform as designed.

End-to-End Tests
For end-to-end testing, use ng e2e. This requires a prior setup of a testing package that can execute end-to-end testing scenarios.
